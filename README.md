Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries. 
It is widely used for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity, and verifying the authenticity of communications. 
In modern cryptography, two main types of cryptographic algorithms are used: symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of these cryptographic techniques and how you can implement them using C programming
